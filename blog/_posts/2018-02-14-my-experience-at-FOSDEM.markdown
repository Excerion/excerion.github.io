I was present at FOSDEM recently. This was my first time visiting an open-source convention. I'm documenting the experience here.

I went with a couple of friends. We left from Utrecht (in the centre of the Netherlands) and the conference is held at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles (Free University of Brussels), so we had to leave early in the morning. The first thing we did after arriving was familiarizing ourselves with the area. It's an interesting campus. There are a lot of hills, so they built entrances to the buildings at multiple levels. It's funny to walk into a building and already be on the second floor.

After sitting down for a cup of coffee and getting a printed schedule, we went to the first talk we wanted to hear. We arrived 30 minutes before it started, but it turned out that this wasn't early enough: we were confronted with a sign that spelt, in big, red letters: FULL. That was a sign we'd stare at many times during the weekend. FOSDEM is a crowded conference. Not that you always need to be that early. The subject matter of that talk, which was quantum computing, must've drawn especially many people, and it was one of the first talks of the day so people could be there early. So we went to the room opposite it, where there was an introduction to the Ada programming language. This was okay. It's cool to learn about, but not something I plan to use, which made me feel a bit bored.

After that, my friends and I parted ways. They went to Tool the Docs, while I wanted to go to the Retrocomputing room. They were going to restore a thirty-year-old Minitel server on an Apple II. Those things are from before my time, so this would've been my first introduction to them, except that the talk got canceled. I would not regret going there, however. The organizers filled the gap with an improvisation: they asked the audience about their own retrocomputers. The question that was posed was: "who has the oldest computer?" I had to contain myself, as it wasn't the right question. I heard something about [...]. Then, another question was posed: "who has the greatest computer?" Bingo. I showed them my HP 100LX digital organizer. I had an opportunity then to briefly talk about it in front of the audience. You can see the footage [here].

After that, I went back and forth a bit between Decentralized internet & privacy, and the retrocomputing room. I found the talks at the former room to be of lower quality. During one of the talks, there were some technical issues with the video projector, so a technician came in to fix it, and even though it was taking a while, the speaker just leaned back. She only continued the talk at the request of an audience member. I feel like that says something about how enthusiastic she really was about communicating the information to us.

Another interesting talk was Making Open Source Hardware for Retrogaming on Raspberry Pi. The speaker 

- Perfectly fine for less technical minded people.
