I was present at FOSDEM recently. This was my first time visiting an open-source convention. I'm documenting the experience here.

I went with a couple of friends. We left from Utrecht (in the centre of the Netherlands) and the conference is held at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles (Free University of Brussels), so we had to leave early in the morning. The first thing we did after arriving was familiarizing ourselves with the area. It's an interesting campus. There are a lot of hills, so they built entrances to the buildings at multiple levels. It's funny to walk into a building and already be on the second floor.

After sitting down for a cup of coffee and getting a printed schedule, we went to the first talk we wanted to hear. We arrived 30 minutes before it started, but it turned out that this wasn't early enough: we were confronted with a sign that spelt, in big, red letters: FULL. That was a sign we'd stare at many times during the weekend. FOSDEM is a crowded conference. Not that you always need to be that early. The subject matter of that talk, which was quantum computing, must've drawn especially many people, and it was one of the first talks of the day so people could be there early. So we went to the room opposite it, where there was an introduction to the Ada programming language. This was okay. It's cool to learn about, but not something I plan to use, which made me feel a bit bored.
