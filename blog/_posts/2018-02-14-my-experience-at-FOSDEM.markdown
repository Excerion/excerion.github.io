I was present at FOSDEM recently. This was my first time visiting an open-source convention. I'm documenting the experience here.

I went with a couple of friends. We left from Utrecht (in the centre of the Netherlands) and the conference is held at the UniversitÃ© libre de Bruxelles (Free University of Brussels), so we had to leave early in the morning. Inside Brussels, we encountered an interesting traffic light that said **Stop** meat while it was red, and **go** vegan while it was green. The first thing we did after arriving was familiarizing ourselves with the area. It's an interesting campus. There are a lot of hills, so they built entrances to the buildings at multiple levels. It's funny to walk into a building and already be on the second floor.

After sitting down for a cup of coffee and getting a printed schedule, we went to the first talk we wanted to hear. We arrived 30 minutes before it started, but it turned out that this wasn't early enough: we were confronted with a sign that spelt, in big, red letters: FULL. That was a sign we'd stare at many times during the weekend. FOSDEM is a crowded conference. Not that you always need to be that early. The subject matter of that talk, which was quantum computing, must've drawn especially many people, and it was one of the first talks of the day so people could be there early. So we went to the room opposite it, where there was an introduction to the Ada programming language. This was okay. It's cool to learn about, but not something I plan to use, which made me feel a bit bored.

After that, my friends and I parted ways. They went to Tool the Docs, while I wanted to go to the Retrocomputing room. They were going to restore a thirty-year-old Minitel server on an Apple II. Those things are from before my time, so this would've been my first introduction to them, except that the talk got canceled. I would not regret going there, however. The organizers filled the gap with an improvisation: they asked the audience about their own retrocomputers. The question that was posed was: "who has the oldest computer?" I had to contain myself, as it wasn't the right question. I heard something about [...]. Then, another question was posed: "who has the greatest computer?" Bingo. I showed them my HP 100LX digital organizer. I had an opportunity then to briefly talk about it in front of the audience. You can see the footage [here].

After that, I went back and forth a bit between Decentralized internet & privacy, and the retrocomputing room. I found the talks at the former room to be of lower quality. During one of the talks, there were some technical issues with the video projector, so a technician came in to fix it, and even though it was taking a while, the speaker just leaned back. She only continued the talk at the request of an audience member. I feel like that says something about how enthusiastic she really was about communicating the information to us.

Another interesting talk was Making Open Source Hardware for Retrogaming on Raspberry Pi. The speaker had designed a gamepad with an RPi at its heart. At the end, the speaker showed us an integrated circuit and said he'd give one to anyone who'd ask a question. There was nothing in particular I wanted to ask, but I wanted one of them. I immediately asked: "how you doing?" and got my circuit. That was the last retrocomputing talk I wanted to go to. I left with a contented feeling.

As I was reviewing the schedule, I noticed a lot of interesting talks in a room called Collaborative information and CMS applications. Many of them were about Wikis. I've used MediaWiki and TiddlyWiki as a personal knowledge base in the past, and Wiki software in general interests me. So I went to that room and stayed there for the rest of the afternoon.

The Wiki talks were interesting, but not spectacular. The talk about Tiki Wiki did not give an overview of the software, but rather the speaker just gave a walkthrough of him fiddling in the admin panel. That isn't something I'd watch for leisure. I'd prefer he gave me more of an overview, and reasons to use that software package in the first place.

Then there was a talk about LibreOffice Online. I only stayed for this talk to avoid walking around, but I don't actually like LibreOffice. The speaker expressed a sense of superiority about WYSIWYG editors, calling others "stuck in the past". This was a bit of an eye opener for me. I had assumed that WYSIWYG users simply hadn't considered the alternatives, but here I saw someone who actually preferred the paradigm.

- Perfectly fine for less technical minded people.
